Title: Top 10 Time Savers for the Stuff You're Too Busy to Do

![image/jpeg][0]

We've all had days where we feel a little rushed and can't be bothered with things like breakfast, a workout, or that grocery shopping you've been putting off. Make all those chores easier with these time-saving tips.

### 10. Pay Your Bills Automatically

If you're sick of taking time out of your day to slog through all your bills, you can make your life a lot easier with [automatic, recurring payments][2]. With auto-pay, email alerts, and [a good budgeting program][3], you can make the process a lot easier. Already got auto bill pay? How about automatic bill reduction? We all know [a simple phone call can reduce your bills][4], but if you don't want to deal with that every few months, [check out a service like BillCutterz][5] that does it for you.

### 9. Improve Your Long Commute

Your commute to work doesn't have to be a boring trek down a five lane highway full of traffic. Not only is there an art to [finding a better route][7], but there's an art to using that time wisely, too. You can [outsmart traffic with a few apps][8] and beat your boredom with something like podcasts, or even [get work done with a voice recorder][9]. If you wanted, you could even [learn a new skill while you commute][10], like [practice a new language][11]. __Photo by [kusuriuri][12] (Shutterstock), [Fontana][13] (Shutterstock), [Lilkar][14] (Shutterstock), and [Nelli Shuyskaya][15] (Shutterstock)_._

### 8. Learn to Read Faster (and Fit It In)

Whether you're reading for pleasure or have mountains of textbooks to wade through for school, reading is one of those things we never feel like we have time for. It is possible, though: with [a bit of effort][17], you can easily fit reading into your busy schedule. And if that isn't enough, [use some simple techniques][18]—like [not saying words in your head][19]—to actually read faster and get through those books. _Photo_ remixed from [silver-john][20] (Shutterstock) and [gladcov][21] (Shutterstock).

### 7. Speed Through Laundry (and Getting Dressed)

Whether it's putting on a tie in the morning or washing those clothes when you get home, clothing-related chores can make nudist colonies pretty appealing. We've shown you [a ton of ways to speed up laundry before][23], and getting dressed and out the door in the morning is just as easy. You can tie a [tie in only 5 seconds][24], and [shoes even faster than that][25]—not to mention [cut your ironing time in half with aluminum foil][26] (or [get rid of wrinkles with a damp towel][27] if you don't have time for ironing at all). After all, it [makes a big difference in how you're perceived at work][28]. _Photo_ by [bark][29].

### 6. Cook Better Food In Less Time

If the idea of cooking a real, honest-to-goodness meal just fills you with dread (whether because you hate cooking or you just don't have the time), fear not: you can overcome. We've shared [10 easy dishes and drinks everyone can make at home][31], not to mention the even-easier [tricks for people who hate cooking][32]. For the time-crunched, breakfast can be the toughest meal, though—but it's one of the most important. The best way to keep breakfast in your routine is to prepare it all in advance, whether it's [oatmeal in jars][33] or [a batch of egg sandwiches in a muffin tin][34]. _P_hoto by [Gatanass][35].

### 5. Get Your Shopping Done, Stress-Free

Somewhat related to cooking, shopping—particularly grocery shopping—is one of those time-consuming activities we never want to do, but have to. There [are a lot of apps][37] that can help you get through the store faster, and [getting groceries online][38] can be a great way to cut down on shopping, too. If there's one thing I personally found helped the most, though, it's [planning the week's meals in advance][39]. If you know what you're going to eat ahead of time, you only ever have to go shopping once, and you won't be rushing to the store because your pantry is unexplainably empty. __Illustration by [Dominick Rabrun][40].

### 4. Sleep Better Without Sleeping Longer

If your sleep schedule is suffering, you might need more sleep—or you might just need _better_ sleep. If your sleep cycle is a mess, you may need to [give it a full reboot][42] before you figure out how much is right for you. But once you do, giving yourself the right environment, preparation, and timing will get you to [sleep better so you need less of it][43]. And if that isn't enough on occasion, you could always grab a [scientifically sound][44][power nap][45], too. __Photo by [Mislav Marohnić][46]_._

### 3. Keep the House in an Always-Clean State

When we start feeling too busy, cleaning is one of the first things to go. But keeping your house clean doesn't have to take any time, as long as you remember to do it. Heck, when you need to, you can [clean your whole house in 15 minutes][48]—but a better solution is to just [clean for 15 minutes a day][49]. Even if the house isn't clean after those 15 minutes, over time, it will be. You don't even need to keep it spotless, either—just in a [20-minutes-to-clean state][50]. And if all else fails...well, [you can always fake it][51], too. __Photo by [Maarten Takens][52]_._

### 2. Fit In a Workout, No Matter Your Schedule

You [don't need to waste hours a day][54] at the gym to stay fit. Depending on your goals, you can often get in a good workout in 30 minutes or less, whether its [interval training][55], [bodyweight exercises][56], or a [little combination of everything][57]. Check out our guide to [fitting a workout into your busy schedule][58] for tips on staying motivated, and you'll find it's easier than you thought. _Image_ by [Taylor Medlin][59] (The Noun Project), [Leremy][60] (Shutterstock), [Official U.S. Navy Imagery][61], and [The Noun Project][62].

### 1. Escape the Cult of Busy

Chances are, you're [not really as busy as you think you are][64]. All it takes is a few small modifications to turn a seemingly-packed schedule into something you can work with, and while it sounds like a cop-out, the best way to make time for yourself is to just [erase &quot;I don't have time&quot; from your vocabulary][65]. If you [make these things a priority][66], you'll get them done—sometimes it's as simple as that_._
