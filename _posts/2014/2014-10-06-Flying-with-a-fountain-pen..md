Title: Flying with a fountain pen.

I frequently fly as a passenger in commercial airliners and as a pilot in my own light aircraft. Taking a fountain pen, full or otherwise has never been a problem, and I use my pens during flight. There are some simple procedures to follow to prevent leaks, which are based on the fundamental gas laws.  
  
1. If possible, store your pen nib up during ascent, so that air, and not ink, is expelled through the nib during this phase of flight.  
  
2. Do not use your pen during ascent to cruising altitude. (That would violate rule #1, but it will write a VERY WET line if you do.)  
  
3. Uncap your pen, nib up, once altitude is reached. (In case your cap seals very tightly against the nib section.)  
  
4. If possible, travel with as full as possible pen to minimize the total volume of expanding air in the ink reservoir.  
  
5. Do not worry about using your pen at altitude or during descent.  
  
For the physics: an airliner or light aircraft traveling at normal cruise altitudes will have a cabin pressure of about 8000 feet, which is maybe 25% less pressure than sea level atmospheric pressure. That means that any air in your fountain pen is going to expand about 25% in volume during climb to altitude. If the nib is down, a small amount of ink might be expelled, depending on the volume of air in the reservoir. If the nib is up (as in a shirt pocket) air can be harmlessly expelled through the nib and any collateral ink moved around in the nib as the air escapes can be soaked up by the feed. Once at altitude, the pen will work perfectly well and should not be at any increased risk for leaking. On the descent to landing, air will be forced into the nib, so leakage should not be a problem. If you travel with pens that cannot be stored nib up or tightly sealed, then you may want to minimize air in the reservoir before travel. I have rarely, rarely had pens leak during air travel. The main hazard with traveling with FPs now is that you can't take your ink with you easily because of the liquids restrictions, unless you enter the checked baggage lottery. (My luggage seems to frequently get lost on commercial flights.)

Cheers.
