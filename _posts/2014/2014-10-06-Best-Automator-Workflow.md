Title: Show Us Your Best Automator Workflow

![image/jpeg][0]

Automator for Mac OSX is a scripting solution that lets you create simple actions, then bundle them into workflows to automate repetitive tasks. Perhaps the best part is that once you've got a workflow, you can package and distribute it as a standalone app. We'd like to see what you're doing with it.

We've shown you how you can use [Automator][1] to do all kinds of interesting things. You can [quickly quit all running applications][2], automatically [delete a DMG file][3] when you eject it, and even get [multiple Dropbox accounts][4] running on your Mac. Now, it's your turn. Show us your best Automator workflow below.
