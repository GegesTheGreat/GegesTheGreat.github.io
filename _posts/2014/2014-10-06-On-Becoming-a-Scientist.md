Title: On Becoming a Scientist

 Bruce Alberts Bruce Alberts is Editor-in-Chief of Science.

One normally becomes a scientist through a series of apprenticeships,

pursuing research in laboratories directed by established scientists.

My own scientific mentors were Jacques Fresco and Paul Doty at

Harvard, where I learned not only technical skills but also how to

think and function as a scientist. Both from them, and by making my

own mistakes,* I learned how to identify important problems, how to

think critically, and how to design effective research strategies.

Because so much of oneâ€™s scientific future is shaped by early

experiences, it is critical that beginning scientists select their

mentors wisely. Unfortunately, what constitutes a &quot;good&quot; choice is not

always obvious. Here I offer some personal advice to help young

scientists make these tough decisions wisely.

The exact project pursued for a Ph.D. degree is not nearly as

important as finding the best place for learning how to push forward

the frontier of knowledge as an independent investigator. My first

piece of advice for graduate students is to begin research training in

a laboratory led by a person with high scientific and ethical

standards. It is by talking to people in that lab or those who have

previously trained there, and by consulting other scientists in the

same field, that one can gain this important insight.

It is also important to find an adviser who will pay close attention

to your development as a scientist. Brilliant scientists sometimes

make poor mentors. Often, an established leader who has no more than

about a dozen people to manage can best nurture a creative, exciting,

and supportive place to work. But carrying out research with an

outstanding new professor with a very small group can frequently

provide even better training.

Students enter graduate school both to learn how to do science well

and to discover where their talents and interests lie. Success at

either task requires that they be empowered to create new approaches

and to generate new ideas. In my experience, beginning scientists will

only gain the confidence needed to confront the unknown successfully

by making discoveries through experiments of their own design. The

best research advisers will therefore provide their graduate students

with enough guidance to prevent them from wasting time on

nonproductive pursuits, while giving them the freedom to innovate and

to learn from their own mistakes.

In my field of biology, two apprenticeships are standard for beginning

scientists: first while earning a Ph.D. degree and then in a second

laboratory in a postdoctoral position. The choice of a postdoctoral

laboratory is best made with a long-term career plan in mind.

Scientists at this stage should intentionally try to choose a

laboratory where they can acquire skills that complement those they

already have. For example, a student whose Ph.D. thesis gave her

strong skills as a yeast geneticist might choose to do postdoctoral

research with an expert protein biochemist, planning to later use a

combination of powerful genetic and biochemical tools to attack a

biological problem in an area where very few scientists have the same

abilities.

But success as an independent scientist will require much more than

technical skills. It is critical to be able to design research

strategies that are ambitious enough to be important and exciting,

innovative enough to make unique contributions likely, and

nevertheless have a good chance of producing valuable results. An

enormous number of different experiments are possible, but only a tiny

proportion will be really worthwhile. Choosing well requires great

thought and creativity, and it involves taking risks.

Senior scientists have the responsibility of maintaining a system that

provides talented young scientists with the opportunity to succeed in

whatever career they choose. My next editorial addresses the

importance of ensuring that innovation and risk-taking are rewarded

for those pursuing a life of independent research. Also, a new series

in Science Careers highlights conversations with audacious scientists

who give their own advice about selecting institutions, mentors, and

 projects.
