1. Linux commands (every important command, there must be a reason why it exists for more than 30 years. Who knows Python or java will stay forever?) and Bash (glue Linux commands together) (It seems Python is cool[life is short, you need Python]. But Let's just wait. All things that not come together with Linux system, we can wait)

2. Emacs (stop investing time on other text editors)

3. Matlab 

4. Latex

5. cook (sounds funny. But at the end of the day, you know the exact combination you want, both nutrition and taste)
