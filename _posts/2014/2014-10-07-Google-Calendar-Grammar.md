If you have a name of a location that includes a date or time word, such as 'Taco Tuesdays' or 'Caf√à 3pm,' use quotation marks around the name to avoid Quick Add from creating the event on Tuesday or at 3pm.

- Enter [lunch with John at "Taco Tuesdays" Friday 12 pm]

If you enter a time with no date, Quick Add will create the event on the earliest date that puts the event in the future; the present day if the time is later, or the next day if the time has already passed:

- Enter [Volleyball at 5pm]

If you do not enter a start time or end time, Quick Add will create an All Day event:
- Enter [Bank holiday 8/14]

If you don't enter an end time, Quick Add will create a one hour long event:

- Enter [Staff meeting next Monday at 13:00]

You can specify start and end times using either time ranges or time intervals:

- Enter [Running w/ Pat 2:15 tomorrow for 45 minutes]
- Enter [Running w/ Pat 2:15 - 3 pm tomorrow]

Multi-day events can be specified using date ranges:

- Enter [National Conference 9/23 - 9/26 in Atlanta]

Three-letter time zone abbreviations can be recognized following the time:

- Enter [Call New York at 3 pm EDT]
