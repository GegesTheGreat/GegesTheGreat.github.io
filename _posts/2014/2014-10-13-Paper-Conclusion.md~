1. Summing up, we have shown that ...

1. We have presented efficient algorithms for find simple paths in graph based on the color-coding technique, and several biologically-motivated extensions of this technique.

2. while these results are promising, there are a number of possible improvements that could be incorporated into this framework: (1) adapt the color coding methodology to identify ...; and (2) extend ..... In addition, our algorithm clould be applied to other biological networks, most evidently to metabolic networks.
