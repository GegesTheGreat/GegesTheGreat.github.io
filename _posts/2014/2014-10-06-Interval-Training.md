![image/jpeg][0]

Interval training, we've noted quite a few times, is a [great way to get fit in a short amount of time][1]. _High-intensity_ interval training (HIIT), as the name suggests, is even more intense and effective for burning fat. Here's a complete guide to HIIT workouts in one handy infographic.

Created by the folks at Greatist, the infographic describes how high-intensity training works your body to the highest amount of oxygen use and results in [the &quot;afterburn&quot; effect][2], so your body keeps burning calories after the workout.
