1. Approximate location services have been proposed in various forms. For example, in the grid location service (GLS) [17],...

2. The authors considered the so-called fixed channel approach whereby the radio is assumed to ...

3. ..., and more specifically, they studied the effect of multipacket reception capability on the capacity...

4. In [22], Steenstrup reconsider the problem and conclude that ...

5. In [22], Steenstrup studied how to assign frequency bands at each node to form a topology such that a certain performance metric can be optimized.

6. Early investigation by Kleinrock and Silvester [2] focused on maximizing the distance a data packet traveres in a single hop toward the desired direction under different transmission protocols.

7. Other networking researchers have applied game theory to congestion pricing [13], and splitting revenue between multiple providers [14], but none of these models capture all of the aspects of the structure of the wifi pricing situation we study in this work.

8. Although there is some work on spectrum sharing for single-hop communications (see, e.g., [4],[18] and references therein), there is limited amount of work available in the literature on multi-hop wireless networking with SDRs.

9. Our work is closest in spirit to the DREAM algorithm [2].

10. The program QUASAR [3] is the closest precursor to the work presented in this paper. 

11. closest to our work in the literature on distributed caching are [7], [19].

12. Our work is complimentary to the above works in several aspects. In contrast to [4] and [20]-[22], we do not require peers to download more than they are interested in. Furthermore, our focus is on achieving good performance while maintaining the high availability of a replicated tracker-based infrastructure pointed out in [1].

13. Our work differs from of all these above approaches in two key aspects. First, unlike... Second, ...

14. In [22], spatial and temporal correlation is exploited to eliminate ...

15. More recently, ...

16. To some extend, ...

17. This is prompted by the observation that ...

18. The main difference with our work is that in our case, due to the correlation structure and coding model we consdier, the amount of ..., whereas in [11]..., and ...

19. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we address a different problem, that of power control, and also in the way in which...

6. Recently, there have been several efforts towards analysis and design of ...

7. There is a rich body of research on mobility management schemes in the literature, and in the following we only describe a few results which are relevant to our study. Comprehensive surveys are given in [2] and [6].

8. Much research has been done to understand BitTorrent and BitTorrent-like systems.

9. A large number of research proposals have addressed reliable delivery for multicast data, most notably in the context of network-layer multicast.

10. There is a large body of works on 

11. There has been extensive studies on multi-channel, multi-radio (MC-MR) networks (e.g., [1], [2], [6], [10], [12],[13],[11],[17],[19]).

12. A large body of literature investigates..

13. There is a great deal of work on percolation in the mathematics community, but, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been applied before to routing in ad hoc networks.

14. For a more complete overview of location services and their use in a position-based routing, we refere to [18] and references therein.

15. In general, the literature work on network pricing is restricted to theorectical issues, and the results are not easily appicable to real networks.

16. A number of mechanisms to improve TCP's performance is MANET environment have been proposed.

17. There are few recent works that consider multi-torrent environment [1], [19-22]. Neglia et at [1] evaluated the benefits of multiple trackers in terms of improved tracker availability based on measurements.

18. There has been some recent work on applying random routing in ad hoc networks, but the focus, and thus the techniques used, have been quite different from our work.

19. various routing schemes have been studied through simulation by XXX [18].

20. Most of these efforts have focused on understanding the performance of single-torrent systems. Other works have analyzed the general characteristics of BitTorrent traffic and the impact of BitTorrent usage on teh amout of inter-ISP traffic (e.g., [9] and [10]).

21. Current studies on ... in ... focus mainly on ...

22. so far, the existing MAC solutions focus on ...

23. In our opinion, ....exploting ...need to be developed.

24. Guo et al [19] provided measurement results showing that more than 85% of torrent users simultaneously participate in multiple torrents (of differnet files). The authors also used measurements and analytical models to illustrate that the "lifetime" of torrents can be extended if a node that acts an a downloader in one torrent also acts as a seed in another torrent.

25. What is common to all these location services is that they incur overhead by explicitly exchanging location information between nodes, either to update location information in the distributed database, to request the location of a destination node, or both.

26. We can categorize existing results into two groups based on whether static or dynamic provisioning of routes and wavelengths is performed.

27. similar in scope to our work is the solution in [13], where ...

28. similar work where the interplay of data compression and routing is studied can be found in [][], and []. In [], the authors address the problem of ... by using the theory of concave costs applied to single resource aggregation.

29. The related problem of (single-source uncapacitated minimum concave-cost netowrk flow) has been extensively studied (e.g., [][]).
