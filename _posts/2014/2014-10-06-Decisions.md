Title: "If Decisions Can't Make Good, They Shouldn't Be Made At All"

Keeping your emotions in check is always tough when you're faced with a difficult decision. Author Simon Sinek suggests that one of the best ways to counter your emotions is to think about the results of a decision. If nothing good happens, you don't need to make it at all.

Using the example of a frustrated email where someone asks him for a favor, Sinek asks himself, &quot;what good will come from this?&quot; When he realizes that neither sending out an angry reply or a nice one will result in anything good, he decides to send nothing at all. We know [decision fatigue zaps your willpower][0], and the more decisions you can eliminate throughout the day, the better off you'll be.
