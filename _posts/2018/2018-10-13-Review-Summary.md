##Summary

### Reviewer 1

This paper presents a QoSiLAN system for autonomous QoS management and policing in unmanaged LANs. The interesting aspect of this work is that they consider hybrid nature of access technology, and their QoSiLAN uses host co-operation and is independent of access technology. The applications of interest include IPTV and HD video streaming. The authors claim that rate-adaptive encoding in such applications cannot handle congestion issues, and their suggested QoS signaling protocol for cooperative traffic shaping on all hosts in the LAN can be more effective in an autonomous manner.


### Reviewer 2
This paper presents a framework for QoS management within unmanaged LANs such as home networks. Authors combine a number of already existing tools (LLTD, NSIS) with specifically designed technologies (eSPID, policy and admission control solutions) to support resource reservation mechanisms within unmanaged LANs.
