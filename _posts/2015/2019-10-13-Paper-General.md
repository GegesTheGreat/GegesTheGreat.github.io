##Using Academic Language

### Verbs:

In spoken English, the "verb + preposition" is often used to express an action. For written academic style, we often prefer a single verb whenever possible.

Informal: Researchers looked at the way strain builds up around a fault.

Formal: Researchers observed the way strain accumulates around a fault.

### Non-vocabulary-related recommendations

#### Avoid contractions

  e.g., won't -> will not / isn't -> is not / don't -> do not

#### Use the more appropriate formal negative forms

  e.g., not … any ->no / not … much -> little / not many -> few

The analysis did not yield any new results. ->  The analysis yielded no new results.

The problem does not have many viable solutions. -> The problem has few
viable solutions.

### Change negatives to affirmatives
